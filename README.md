# Happy New Year — Personal Site

This is a small, static "Happy New Year" page made as a cute gift. It uses plain HTML/CSS/JS and includes a tulip motif and a small jewel sparkle.

What I added
- index.html — landing page with inline SVG tulips and jewel icon
- styles.css — styling and layout
- script.js — simple confetti and click surprise

How to run locally

1. In your terminal run:

   cd /tmp/project-newyear-gift
   python3 -m http.server 8000

2. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

Enjoy!
